We\u2019re dead set on solving the problem and looking for people to help us achieve our . We, at Winnow, believe that food is far too valuable to waste, and that technology can transform the way we produce food. Our team is made of people who all share a passion for food and technology.\nWinnow was founded in London in 2013 to help the hospitality industry prevent food waste through internet of things tools in the kitchen. We have worked with thousands of sites and are operating in over 90 countries around the world supported by our offices in London, Dubai, Singapore, Cluj-Napoca (Romania) and Chicago. We are a scale-up stage company with a strong base of clients who are rolling out our system globally. We have blue-chip customers including Accor Hotels, IKEA, IHG, Marriott, Compass Group and many others.\nWinnow\u2019s clients on average reduce waste by over 50% by value and sustain savings. Winnow works with hotels, universities and schools, staff restaurants, event\/hospitality kitchens, buffets, pubs, and high street restaurants. Where the system is permanently adopted, pre-consumer waste value is reduced by 50% - 70% with no detrimental impact to the perceived quality or value of the offer to their customers. This represents a typical improvement of food cost savings of 3% to 8%, commonly a 40%+ increase in profitability for operations.\nAs the global leader in addressing food waste, we are committed to continue pushing the envelope on what technology can do to solve this problem. Winnow Vision, our new artificial intelligence-based technology, is trained to automatically track all food waste thrown away. It has won awards at the World Economic Forum and has received tremendous enthusiasm from our clients and the industry.

But a company doing their business taxes is still extremely manual, tedious, and just...painful.\nThat's why neo.tax exists. We want to use modern technology, ranging from automation to machine learning, to bring business taxes into the 21st century.\nWe're starting with the R&D tax credit. Our first product simplifies the complex and difficult process of helping companies apply for the\nIRS R&D Tax Credit\n, which puts hundreds of thousands of dollars into each company's pocket.\nBut this is only the start.\nOur vision is to leverage AI to map the tax genome and help small businesses automate their taxes and optimize their entire financial strategy. In other words, what used to be available to the top 0.1% of companies is now available to all SMBs. In the future, neo.tax will become the essential tax software stack for small businesses.\nWe just raised our series A, and we're now looking to build the team!\nAbout neo.tax\nIf you wanted to solve business taxes, what type of team would you put together?\nPerhaps a former IRS agent with > 20 years of experience as a CPA?\nOr a Stanford PhD in machine learning?\nMaybe a former product manager that worked at Intuit?\nWell...what do you know? That's our co-founders!\nAnd along the way, we've picked up more people from engineering, product, design, sales, and taxes.\nBut now it's time to level up, which is why we need to grow our team. That's why we need your help! If you are intrigued by what you read, check out the open positions below. \ud83d\ude09\nP.S.

Based on award winning research, we\u2019ve developed our patented Foretune\u2122 technology that significantly reduces overall PCB space by lowering the component count whilst increasing the number of supported frequency bands. Our innovative approach to RFFE (Radio Frequency Front End) design architectures is set to overhaul manufacturing processes by replacing fixed frequency duplex filters with a frequency agnostic solution that is dynamically tunable according to available frequencies.\nForetune\u2122 Technology also mitigates the need for multiple variants of the same product depending on geographical market, Mobile Network Operator (MNO) specifications or available frequency bands. Less RF hardware at device level empowers OEMs\/ODMs to simplify the design and manufacturing processes which in turn drives down supply chain waste and overall production costs. With the mobile phone and adjacent markets embracing miniaturization our unique solution also empowers manufacturers to incorporate a range of features into their product ranges without increasing the scarce PCB space and thereby negatively impacting the industrial design.

Our team is made of people who all share a passion for food and technology.\nWinnow was founded in London in 2013 to help the hospitality industry prevent food waste through internet of things tools in the kitchen. We have worked with hundreds of sites and are operating in over 70 countries around the world supported by our offices in London, Dubai, Shanghai, Singapore, Romania and North America. We are a rapidly growing company with a strong base of clients who are rolling out our system globally. We have blue-chip customers including Accor Hotels, IKEA, IHG, Marriott, Compass Group and many others.\nWinnow\u2019s clients on average reduce waste by over 50% by value and sustain savings. Winnow has now worked with hundreds of sites to reduce food waste, including hotels, universities and schools, staff restaurants, event\/hospitality kitchens, buffets, pubs, and high street restaurants. Where the system is permanently adopted, pre-consumer waste value is reduced by 50% - 70% with no detrimental impact to the perceived quality or value of the offer to their customers. This represents a typical improvement of food cost savings of 3% to 8%, commonly a 40%+ increase in profitability for operations.\nAs the global leader in addressing food waste, we are committed to continue pushing the envelope on what technology can do to solve this problem. Winnow Vision, our new artificial intelligence-based technology, is trained to automatically track all food waste thrown away.
