Data Scientist (Mid level),Ravelin,,"Who are we?
Hi! 👋 We are Ravelin! We're a fraud detection company using advanced machine learning and network analysis technology to solve big problems. Our goal is to make online transactions safer and help our clients feel confident serving their customers.
And we have fun in the meantime! We are a friendly bunch and pride ourselves in having a strong culture and adhering to our values of empathy, ambition, unity and integrity. We really value work/life balance and we embrace a flat hierarchy structure company-wide. Join us and you’ll learn fast about cutting-edge tech and work with some of the brightest and nicest people around -

If this sounds like your cup of tea, we would love to hear from you! For more information check out our
blog
to see if you would like to help us prevent crime and protect the world's biggest online businesses.
The Team
You will be joining the Detection team. The Detection team is responsible for keeping fraud rates low – and clients happy – by continuously training and deploying machine learning models. We aim to make model deployments as easy and error free as code deployments. Google’s
Best Practices for ML Engineering
is our bible.
Our models are trained to spot multiple types of fraud, using a variety of data sources and techniques in real time. The prediction pipelines are under strict SLAs, every prediction must be returned in under 300ms. When models are not performing as expected, it’s down to the Detection team to investigate why.
The Detection team is core to Ravelin’s success. They work closely with the Data Engineering Team who build infrastructure and the Intelligence & Investigations Team who liaise with clients.
The Role
We are currently looking for a Data Scientist to help train, deploy, debug and evaluate our fraud detection models. Our ideal candidate is pragmatic, approachable and filled with knowledge tempered by past failures.
Evaluating fraud models is hard; often times we do not even get labels for 3 months. You’ll need to use your judgement when investigating cases of ambiguous fraud and when you’re investigating the veracity of the model itself.
We have to build robust models that are capable of updating their beliefs when they encounter new methods of fraud: our clients expect us to be one step ahead of fraud, not behind. You will be given the equipment, space and guidance you need to build world class fraud detection models.
The work is not all green field research. The everyday work is about making safe incremental progress towards better models for our clients. The ideal candidate is willing to get involved in both aspects of the job – and understand why both are important.
Responsibilities
Build out our model evaluation and training infrastructure.
Develop and deploy new models to detect fraud whilst maintaining SLAs
Write new features in our production infrastructure
Research new techniques to disrupt fraudulent behaviour
Investigate model performance issues (using your experience of debugging models).
Mentor junior members of the team
Requirements
Significant experience building and deploying ML models using the Python data stack (numpy, pandas, sklearn).
Understand software engineering best practices (version control, unit tests, code reviews, CI/CD) and how they apply to machine learning engineering.
Strong analytical skills.
Being a strong collaborator with colleagues outside of your immediate team, for example with client support teams or engineering.
Being skilled at communicating complex technical ideas to a range of audiences.
The ability to prioritise and to manage your workload.
Being comfortable working with a hybrid team
Nice to haves
Experience with Docker, Kubernetes and ML production infrastructure.
Tensorflow and deep learning experience.
Experience using dbt.
Experience with Go, C++, Java or another systems language.

The role
We are now looking for a Machine Learning Research Engineer to help build and deliver a platform that can automatically create Virtual Agents for operational processes currently undertaken manually using browser-based UIs. An important part of our offering is the ability to interact with a customer’s existing tooling, and we have found encoding repetitive interactions as Python code to be a powerful strategy. We envision the need for an “Agent Factory” that can compile the deterministic portions of workflows into reliable, testable code. This “Agent Factory” will learn from captured demonstrations of workflows and transform our customers' manual processes into automated solutions that combine the speed and reliability of code with the power of AI, where reasoning is needed.
Your will be to create capabilities that automate the creation and management of Virtual Agents.
You will use your knowledge of Agentic approaches for code generation and software engineering best practices to design and develop these capabilities - leveraging state-of-the-art LLM coding frameworks and endowing them with the tools and guardrails needed to reliably build and test automated workflows. You will work with customer-facing technical teams to configure and deploy the Virtual Agents for customer work.
You will push the boundaries of Agentic automation, leveraging the best-in-class capabilities where it’s appropriate and developing in-house when we need to.
You will work with platform and software engineers to turn these capabilities into robust operational systems that can scale to deliver Virtual Agents to most operational processes currently undertaken by humans.
As part of this role, you will:
Design and build capabilities that create Virtual Agents - an “Agent Factory”
Robustly evaluate the agent creation process, allowing a systematic improvement in capabilities through experimentation against benchmarks
Implement code generation capabilities, guardrails and evaluations, specialised for encoding workflows based on customer documentation and input, such as captured browser demonstrations
Drive the uptake of these capabilities with our customer-facing technical teams
Utilise best-in-class capabilities to deliver these capabilities
Research, invent and create novel capabilities where gaps in industry require it
Participate in our machine learning community to influence how we implement machine learning and computer vision technologies, shaping Unitary's future.
Contribute full-stack development, including software engineering, DevOps, and MLOps, along with light task and project management to ensure your capabilities deliver maximum value early.

We have (1) Transcribe Workspace, a web application that serves over 5000 monthly active users, assisting them to transform their conversations into insights, and (2) Transcribe API, a solution that embeds speech-to-text and text analytics solutions into agency systems.
What you will be working on
As an AI engineer, you will:
Build prototypes to demonstrate technology opportunities
Design system architectures while accounting for security and infrastructure constraints
Write production quality code
Know how to best utilise and integrate AI platform services during application development
Backend and/or frontend application development within a containerised microservices architecture

Collaborate with various stakeholders to ensure necessary inputs are aligned and application is cleared for deployment
Learn and share knowledge in a multi-disciplinary team
Additionally, more senior engineers will be expected to:
Establish best practices
Share your expertise and mentor other engineers
You are not just here to write code, but also to figure out what we should be building and how we should build it.
Your job will be to bring expertise and capability to the public sector. Sometimes this means coding new systems from scratch. Other times this means using the best solutions the community has to offer. We use cloud services, open source software, and commodity hardware as far as possible. Knowing what to build and what to reuse lets us avoid wasting time on solved problems and focus on delivering actual value.
What it is like working here
We build products that serve a variety of agency users, who use them to solve highly meaningful problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.
Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.
Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability.
Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.
Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.
Requirements
Proficiency in backend application development in Python and/or GoLang
Strong software engineering passion
Ability to design and build software, solve abstract problems, and reason and communicate clearly about code
Able to integrate application code with other services such as databases (e.g. MongoDB, Postgres), caches (e.g. Redis), etc

Stock Option Plan","Help us bring business taxes into the modern age
Rockets are flying into space and landing on drone ships, cars are driving autonomously, and HD video calls can connect people on opposite sides of the globe. But a company doing their business taxes is still extremely manual, tedious, and just...painful.
That's why neo.tax exists. We want to use modern technology, ranging from automation to machine learning, to bring business taxes into the 21st century.
We're starting with the R&D tax credit. Our first product simplifies the complex and difficult process of helping companies apply for the
IRS R&D Tax Credit
, which puts hundreds of thousands of dollars into each company's pocket.
But this is only the start.
Our vision is to leverage AI to map the tax genome and help small businesses automate their taxes and optimize their entire financial strategy. In other words, what used to be available to the top 0.1% of companies is now available to all SMBs. In the future, neo.tax will become the essential tax software stack for small businesses.
We just raised our series A, and we're now looking to build the team!
About neo.tax
If you wanted to solve business taxes, what type of team would you put together?
Perhaps a former IRS agent with > 20 years of experience as a CPA?
Or a Stanford PhD in machine learning?
Maybe a former product manager that worked at Intuit?
Well...what do you know? That's our co-founders!
And along the way, we've picked up more people from engineering, product, design, sales, and taxes.
But now it's time to level up, which is why we need to grow our team. That's why we need your help! If you are intrigued by what you read, check out the open positions below. 😉
P.S. We are a remote company, but prefer to hire in time zones that can overlap with our HQ in Mountain View, CA.
neo.tax is committed to being an equal opportunity employer.
neo.tax is an equal opportunity employer and values diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

PostgreSQL: our core backend database powering all Ventrata applications
Keboola: for ingesting external data sources (e.g. Xero accounting data) into BigQuery
Google Tag Manager (GTM) and Google Analytics 4 (GA4): for managing client side tracking and analytics integrations.
Requirements
Who we are looking for
Experience: 3+ years in data analytics or data engineering, with a focus on building and maintaining data pipelines in cloud data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake, etc.).
SQL Expertise: Proficient in SQL and able to write modular, maintainable queries. Familiarity with SQL-based transformation frameworks like Dataform or dbt is a must.
BI & Data Modeling: Experience with business intelligence tools (e.g. GoodData, Looker, Power BI, Tableau). Ability to design logical data models, define clear metrics, and develop insightful dashboards.
Communication: Excellent communication and documentation skills to be able to explain complex data concepts to both technical and non technical stakeholders clearly.
Self-Driven: High degree of ownership and independence. Proven ability to prioritize tasks, adapt to changing requirements, and meet deadlines. We are a startup, so an agile mindset and enthusiasm for continuous learning are crucial.
Bonus Points For...
Experience with product analytics tools like PostHog, Mixpanel, or Amplitude.
Knowledge of web analytics and tracking instrumentation (GTM, GA4).

For too long, compute—the foundation of artificial intelligence—has been controlled by a small handful of corporations, consolidated into proprietary data centers, and rationed out to those willing to pay the highest price. The result is an innovation bottleneck. AI models are no longer limited by ideas, talent, or research. They are limited by access.

Requirements
Sidetrade is launching a brand new, high-impact engineering initiative to build a company-wide platform for internal autonomous agents.
These agents will fundamentally change how every business function operates, from Customer Success, Finance, Product, Sales and Operations, by automating high-volume workflows through intelligent, end-to-end systems.
As an AI Engineer, you will design, architect and deploy these autonomous agents at scale. This is real production engineering: agents that plan, reason, orchestrate tools, call APIs, manage state and execute reliably inside a live enterprise environment.
You will be part of the founding team shaping this initiative from day one. You will define the architecture, select the frameworks, and establish the engineering patterns that will power Sidetrade’s internal agent platform for years. The agents you build will be used daily across the organisation and will deliver measurable impact immediately.
This is a rare greenfield opportunity. If you are excited by modern agent frameworks and want to build next generation agentic systems that change how a company operates you will thrive here.
You will operate at the intersection of AI engineering, workflow design, process intelligence and automation. This role gives you the runway to build something transformational and to work at the forefront of applied enterprise AI within a small, senior and high ownership team.
What you'll be doing:
Build and deploy internal AI agents
Design and develop autonomous agents using frameworks such as Kubiya, Agno, CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph, Rasa, Botpress or similar
You will build agents that reason, call tools and APIs, work with internal data and complete real operational tasks end to end
Translate business workflows into agent behaviour
Partner with business teams to understand how work is done and where automation creates the most value
Turn these workflows into clear agent behaviours: when the agent should trigger, which data it needs, what actions it performs and what output it must deliver
Orchestrate agents using automation tools
Use tools like n8n (or equivalents) to coordinate agent steps, route data, manage inputs and outputs, and connect agents to the right systems across the organisation
Integrate agents with enterprise systems
Connect agents to the systems teams use every day; CRM, ticketing, analytics, product logs, finance tools, operational platforms and internal APIs
Ensure smooth data flow, solid error handling and predictable execution
Run, monitor and iterate agents in production
Deploy agents internally, observe how they’re used and iterate based on performance, reliability and user feedback
Work closely with a dedicated PMO/Program Lead for prioritisation and delivery
Influence the technical direction of internal agents at Sidetrade
Because this initiative is brand new, you will help shape how we design, document and scale internal agents across departments
Stay ahead of the curve on agent frameworks, LLM orchestration patterns and emerging best practices
What You'll Need to be Successful
Core Skills (Must-Have)
Minimum one year of hands-on experience building AI agents or agentic workflows in production, not prototypes
Proficiency with at least one modern agent framework: n8n / Beam AI / Langflow or an equivalent production-grade agent stack
Ability to translate real business processes into structured agent behaviours: triggers, tool use, reasoning loops, memory/state models
Solid engineering fundamentals, ideally Python: APIs, data manipulation, error handling, testing
Understanding of multi-step reasoning, planning, tool orchestration, context propagation and state management
Experience integrating agents with enterprise systems (APIs, CRMs, ERPs, ticketing, logs, internal services)

For more information, visit:
https://www.dialectica.io/
About the Tech Team
Technology powers everything we do at Dialectica. To date, the team consists of 100+ people across Software Engineering, Product & Design, and TechOps, and is expected to grow further in 2026. We have built our own proprietary web application that automates and optimizes the delivery of our market-leading services.
Our stack is diverse and modern. We don't just do data; we build full-scale applications using technologies like TypeScript, React, Node.js, Go, GraphQL, and Kubernetes alongside our core data stack on AWS.
About the Role: The ""Super Weapon"" We Need
We are not just looking for someone to build ETL pipelines. We are seeking a Staff Data Engineer with a Full Stack mindset—a technical leader capable of bridging the gap between application development and data infrastructure.
You are the missing link. You understand that data quality begins in the microservice that generates an event, not just in the data warehouse. You are capable of looking at the entire lifecycle of information: from the React frontend user action, through the Node.js/Go backend services, down into the Data Lake, and back up into high-performance APIs for analytics.
In this critical leadership role based out of our Bogota hub, you will architect systems where data is treated as a first-class software product. You will mentor senior engineers, define our long-term technical strategy for data, and ensure our architecture can scale exponentially.
As a Staff Data Engineer (Full Stack Focus) you will:
Architect End-to-End Systems: Go beyond traditional data pipelining. Design and oversee the implementation of complex, distributed data architectures that span ingestion, processing, storage, and serving layers on AWS.
Bridge App & Data: Collaborate deeply with Backend and Frontend engineering teams during the design phase of new features. You will influence database schema design in microservices and define event estandards to ensure data is usable downstream before code is even written.
API & Consumption Layer Design: Don't just dump data into a warehouse. Architect high-performance data access layers (e.g., GraphQL APIs, low-latency lookups via Redis) that allow our product teams to consume processed data easily and efficiently in the UI.
Elevate Engineering Standards: Define and enforce best practices for Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), CI/CD for data products, data testing, and observability capabilities across the entire stack.
Technical Leadership & Mentorship: Serve as a technical beacon for the data organization. Mentor Senior Data Engineers, conduct high-level code reviews, and drive pragmatic technical decision-making that balances immediate business needs with long-term scalability.
Solve the ""Hardest"" Problems: Take ownership of the most complex, intractable technical challenges related to data consistency, real-time processing, and cross-system integrations.
Requirements
We have seen that people who successfully fit in this position have:
8+ years of combined experience in Software Engineering and Data Engineering, with at least 3 years operating at a Senior or Lead level.
True ""Full Stack"" Exposure: You must have a background in core software engineering beyond just SQL and Python scripts. You should be comfortable navigating backend codebases (e.g., Node.js, Go, or Python application code) to understand how data is generated.
Mastery of Modern Data Stacks: Deep expertise in Python, advanced SQL, and architecting Production Data Lakes/Warehouses on cloud platforms (AWS preferred).
Architectural Expertise: Strong background in distributed systems design, event-driven architecture (Kafka, Kinesis, SNS/SQS), and microservices patterns. You understand the trade-offs between consistency and availability (CAP theorem) in real-world scenarios.
Infrastructure as Code: Deep hands-on experience with Kubernetes, Docker, and Terraform. You don't just use infrastructure; you design it.
Advanced Tooling: Expert-level knowledge of orchestration tools (Airflow, Dagster) and modern transformation tools like DBT.
A Product Mindset: You don't just serve data; you understand the business value of what you are building and how it impacts the end-user experience.
Fluency in English is a must.
Bonus points for ""Super Weapons"":
Experience implementing or heavily utilizing GraphQL for a data-heavy frontend.
Experience migrating monolithic applications/databases toward event-driven microservices.
Active contributions to open-source data or infrastructure projects.
Benefits
Competitive salary pegged to international standards with performance incentives.
Premium Prepaid Medicine (Medicina Prepagada) coverage.
Flexible Hybrid or Remote work model based in Bogota.

Data Engineer,The Cruise Globe,,"🌊🚀 Who We Are
The Cruise Globe is building the world’s leading digital platform for cruise travellers.
At its core, The Cruise Globe is a data business. Our platform enables users to log cruises, visualise exact routes, track distances travelled, and explore detailed statistics about their journeys. As the product expands across new features and revenue streams, the quality, structure, and scalability of our data systems are fundamental to everything we do.
We operate a small but experienced data function today, and we are now investing in a full-time hire to take our data platform to the next stage of maturity.
Requirements
🚀 The Opportunity
We are hiring a Data Engineer to help build, scale, and maintain the data foundations of The Cruise Globe.
This role exists because our data systems have reached an inflection point. We have an exceptional volume of data and strong foundations, but the business now needs more structure, automation, and scalability to support increasingly data-heavy product features.
You will work closely with our existing senior data engineer and alongside product and engineering teams to design and operate production-grade data systems. Databricks is a foundational part of our stack, and this role will be central to shaping how it is used as the business grows.
This is not a reporting or dashboard-focused role. It is a hands-on engineering role for someone who enjoys solving complex data challenges, and building durable systems that product teams can rely on with confidence.
Success in this role is defined by:
The product team’s ability to ship data-heavy features with confidence
Data becoming more central to the user experience and value proposition
A clear step-change in scalability, structure, and automation
Reduced reliance on manual or ad-hoc data processes
🧭 What You’ll Be Doing
Build and Scale Core Data Systems
Design, implement, and maintain scalable data systems using Databricks
Help migrate and consolidate existing data workflows into a more robust architecture

Data Engineer,Winnow,hospitality,"About us
Food waste is a $1 trillion problem – costing the world over 1% of global GDP. We’re dead set on solving the problem and looking for people to help us achieve our . We, at Winnow, believe that food is far too valuable to waste, and that technology can transform the way we produce food. Our team is made of people who all share a passion for food and technology.
Winnow was founded in London in 2013 to help the hospitality industry prevent food waste through internet of things tools in the kitchen. We have worked with thousands of sites and are operating in over 90 countries around the world supported by our offices in London, Dubai, Singapore, Cluj-Napoca (Romania) and Chicago. We are a scale-up stage company with a strong base of clients who are rolling out our system globally. We have blue-chip customers including Accor Hotels, IKEA, IHG, Marriott, Compass Group and many others.
Winnow’s clients on average reduce waste by over 50% by value and sustain savings. Winnow works with hotels, universities and schools, staff restaurants, event/hospitality kitchens, buffets, pubs, and high street restaurants. Where the system is permanently adopted, pre-consumer waste value is reduced by 50% - 70% with no detrimental impact to the perceived quality or value of the offer to their customers. This represents a typical improvement of food cost savings of 3% to 8%, commonly a 40%+ increase in profitability for operations.
As the global leader in addressing food waste, we are committed to continue pushing the envelope on what technology can do to solve this problem. Winnow Vision, our new artificial intelligence-based technology, is trained to automatically track all food waste thrown away.

Proficiency with containerization and platform operations (Docker, Kubernetes)
Solid understanding of cloud infrastructure fundamentals, including basic networking and security

Experience supporting batch and/or streaming data systems, focusing on platform reliability rather than business logic
Ability to operate in ambiguous problem spaces and translate organizational needs into reusable platform capabilities
Strong communication skills to explain platform concepts and trade-offs to non-technical stakeholders

Since 2009, Lengow has fueled digital growth for over 3,600 customers across thousands of marketing and sales channels in over 60 countries.
Lengow is a profitable company.
Our Tech team
The Tech, Data, and Product team comprises 70+ people from diverse backgrounds, working in our offices in Nantes, Paris, and Barcelona. Our products are developed thanks to 6 autonomous product Teams, each working on a specific business domain.
The Data team
The Data team (5 members) plays a critical role in supporting both our internal operations and external data offerings across our four core products: NetMarkets, NetAmplify, NetRivals, and NetMonitor.
We achieve this through three main areas:
Empowering internal teams with data-driven decision-making tools, including dashboards, analyses, and reports.
Delivering scalable and maintainable custom data products — primarily dashboards and reports — tailored to client needs.
Building data-based products and features that strengthen and expand our overall product offering.

Lengow is currently in the middle of a data transformation. We’re building a unified data offer to unlock the full potential of data across all our products. This will enable better decision-making, create synergies between client-facing data products, and support the development of data-driven features in close collaboration with other product teams.
At the same time, we are working to increase the scalability and automation of our client-facing data products — especially dashboards and custom reports — which currently still require manual intervention. Additionally:
We are building and refining our data roadmap.
We are strengthening collaboration with other product teams.
We are revamping the data stack by introducing new tools such as dbt, Airflow, Cube, and others, to better align with our long-term data vision.
We operate as a product team, with a clear data roadmap that includes both technical and non-technical initiatives. As part of the team, you’ll mainly focus on technical projects that you propose and agree on with the team, ensuring they deliver concrete business impact.
As of now, some of the most important technical projects in our 2026 data roadmap are:
Enhancing the data warehouse model to improve clarity, consistency, and ease of analysis (including enabling new product features such as content compliance).
Assessing, upgrading, or replacing current data tools to better support scale and maintainability (continuing the evolution of the data stack).
Developing a scalable and maintainable approach to client-facing data products (productization of reports and dashboards).
Category mapping and entity linking to better structure and enrich product data.
s and e
This role is ideal for someone who enjoys solving concrete technical problems while delivering measurable business value. We strongly value your ideas and expect you to actively contribute to shaping technical decisions and improvements.

Staff Data Engineer - Finance & Customer Data,Booksy,,"At Booksy, we are moving beyond traditional ETL. We are building a high-integrity, Zero Copy data ecosystem where BigQuery serves as the immutable ""Source of Truth"" for Finance, and Salesforce Data Cloud serves as the ""Live Record"" for our Sales, Marketing, and CX teams.
As the Customer Staff Engineer, you will own the bridge between these two worlds. You will ensure that every dollar reported to our Board of Directors reconciles perfectly with the customer activity seen on the front lines, all while supporting Data Scientists to leverage Vertex AI to turn that data into predictive growth.
Requirements
What You Will Do
Architect the ""Zero Copy"" Future: Lead the implementation of data sharing between BigQuery and Salesforce Data Cloud. You will ensure we ""connect, not collect,"" reducing latency and storage costs.
Own Financial Integrity: Partner with the VP FP&A to build BigQuery models that serve as the definitive source for ARR, LTV, and Churn. You will ensure these models handle complex logic like refunds, currency normalization, and mid-month plan changes.
Build the Customer 360: Create a unified identity graph that links internal provider IDs, Stripe IDs, and Salesforce Account IDs to provide a 360-degree view of the Booksy partner.
Data Quality & Fraud Defense: Develop automated systems to identify and filter ""Invalid Businesses"" (bots and bad actors) to ensure our AI models and financial reports remain untainted.
AI Enablement: Design and maintain the feature engineering pipelines in Vertex AI that power our predictive models for customer health and retention.
Governance & Mentorship: Define the standards for ""Official"" vs. ""Operational"" reporting. Mentor senior engineers and advocate for a culture of data observability and high-integrity engineering.
Who You Are
The Architect: You have deep experience with Google BigQuery and are an expert in modern data sharing (Zero Copy / Federated Queries). Experience with Salesforce Data Cloud (formerly Genie) is a massive plus.
The ""CFO's Best Friend"": You don't just write SQL; you understand business logic. You know why a ""Booking"" is an operational metric but a ""Successfully Processed Payment"" is a financial one.
Semi-Structured Specialist: You are comfortable handling massive volumes of JSON event data, knowing exactly how to model a lean schema for performance at scale.
Systems Thinker: You look at the ""Identity Map"" and see the backbone of the company. You care about data lineage and how a change in the billing system ripples down to a Sales rep's dashboard.
Staff-Level Leader: You have a track record of leading cross-functional projects that involve stakeholders from Finance, Sales, and Engineering. You can explain complex architectural trade-offs to non-technical executives.
